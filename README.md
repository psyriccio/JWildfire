# JWildfire - an image and animation processor written in Java

## Introduction

JWildire is the spiritual successor of the award winning special effect program Wildfire\7PPC for the Amiga â€“ 
but this time implemented in Java and with a more sophisticated user interface and more cool effects :-)

## Evolution

This fork is created for the implementation of evolutionary algorithms and neural networks functionality. 
And maybe later it will be merged with the main project.
